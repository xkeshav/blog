# Link Alias Syntax in Markdown


## Adding Alias for link

usually what we do to insert a link in markdown file


### Normal way
 normally we use banana syntax i.e. using `[link](address)`; for example

```md title="README.md"

see my [github profile](https://github.com/xkeshav)
```

### Problem

 when we have to write multiple links on multiple place in same document then we have to repeat the same syntax  and sometime same link on multiple places then it is become mess

and sometimes the long link address makes file unreadable


### Solution: Alias

to overcome above issue. we can add link alias and use the alias in place of the link in `[text][alias] `format



```md title="README.md"

> [!NOTE]

below things to consider in syntax

 - no space before opening `[`
 - put one space after colon `:`
 - no space between link and alias `[text][alias]`
 - alias order does not matter
 - you can name alias to number or any word

## Bonus Tip

you can put link either near the snippet or at the ends of content using comment feature;

```markdown title="README.md"
