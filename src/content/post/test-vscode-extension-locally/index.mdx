# Test and Run your VS Code extension locally

## install yo generator for basic boilerplate of vs code

1. Install the yo generator and few other packages to build and test
2. Follow [Your First extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension) from VS Code official blog vs code extension page,
3. open folder of extension code and remove comments, if you want

```sh
> npm install --global yo generator-code
```

then run

```sh
yo code
```

select `typescript` and `esbuild` for the extension; you can choose anything as per the need.

## Code Files

## How to Run the vscode extension

1. Open Command Panel in the vs code where extension codebase is opened
2. Type _Debug_ and choose **Debug: Select and Start Debugging** option
3. Select _Run Extension_ ; you might not see this option then you have some other build or empty/invalid _.vscode/launch.json_ file.

or Open _Run and Debug_ ( `Ctrl + Shift + D` ) tab , the least used tab , from activity bar and select Run Extensions from Drop Down

Note: if you see _Node.js_ as an option then it will check package.json command and you can select to run.

4. it will open new Extension Host Window.
5. whatever you rite in console.log() will be printed on parent Window under _Debug Console_ panel
   Note: if you clear the log then there are chances you will not see that log again, so if you clear then restart complete vs code.

## in Extension Host Window

- Open Command Center ( Ctrl + Shift + P )
- Type the command which is in _package.json_ 's **contributes --> commands --> command** attribute
- make sure the same command must be registered in _src/extension.ts_ under `vscode.commands.registerCommand` method
  command panel will not suggest command until you type , so type complete an correct command name

```json

 "contributes": {
    "commands": [
      {
        "command": "nut-bolt.suggestThemeName",
        "title": "Suggest Theme Name",
        "category": "Theme Zero"
      }
    ]
 }
```

and it will execute and display "Hello World" on Bottom Right panel, this message can be changed in _extension.ts_ file

```ts title="src/extension.ts"
import * as vscode from "vscode";

export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
  console.log('Congratulations, "nut-bolt" is now active!'); // displayed in the parent window, under DEBUG CONSOLE
  const disposable = vscode.commands.registerCommand("nut-bolt.suggestThemeName", async () => {
    vscode.window.showInformationMessage("Hello World nut-bolt!"); // displayed in child window i.e. Extension Host Window
  });
  context.subscriptions.push(disposable);
}
```

it is hot reload so if you make any change in extension code from parent, it will reflect immediately.

## How to debug

- add breakpoint in a file and it reload the debugger or restart the task and now it will stops;
- sometimes you see inactive dot, that will be active when extension start executing that file.

## Bonus

## Install my extension

- if you want to install as a package locally then install `vsce` ( VS Code Extension ) CLI and then run `vsce publish`

```sh
npm install -g @vscode/vsce
vsce publish
```

it will generate `<extension-name>.vsix` file in project directory. copy the file and

open extension panel in vs code and click on `...` in _Extension:MarketPlace Tab_ and then select `Install from VSIX..`. option and choose the downloaded .vsix file.
