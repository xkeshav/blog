# Setting Up a Python Project: A Guide for JavaScript Developers

## For JavaScript Developers

Coming from the JavaScript ecosystem, here are some key parallels:

- Python's `venv` is similar to Node's `nvm`
- `requirements.txt` is similar to `package.json`
- `pip` is similar to `npm/yarn`
- Poetry is similar to `yarn/pnpm` with enhanced features like `package.json` + `yarn.lock` combined

## Prerequisites and Assumptions

### System Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher installed (like Node.js in JavaScript)
- Base setup tested on Ubuntu 24.04, but instructions work for all major OS
- Terminal access (similar to running npm commands)

### Important Assumptions

- All commands assume `/dev/project` as your base path (customize this to your actual project location)
- For Windows users, replace `/` with `\` and adjust paths accordingly (e.g., `C:\dev\project`)
- Project structure exists (similar to having your React/Astro project folder)
- You have necessary permissions (like when you need sudo for global npm installs)

## Initial Project Setup

### Navigate to Project

```bash
# Replace with your actual project path
cd /dev/project

# Windows users:
cd C:\dev\project
```

💡 **Tip**: Like `pwd` in JavaScript projects, you can use `pwd` (Unix) or `cd` (Windows) to verify your current directory

### Installing Developer Tools

```bash
pip3 install vulture ruff
```

💡 **Tip**: These are like ESLint/Prettier in JavaScript ecosystem

## Virtual Environment Setup

Think of this as creating an isolated environment (similar to using different Node versions per project)

### Creating Virtual Environment

```bash
# Unix/macOS
python3 -m venv /dev/project/.venv

# Windows
python -m venv C:\dev\project\.venv
```

💡 **Tip**: `.venv` is similar to `node_modules` - it should be in your `.gitignore`

### Activating Virtual Environment

```bash
# Unix/macOS
source /dev/project/.venv/bin/activate

# Windows
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

💡 **Tip**: You'll see `(.venv)` in your terminal, similar to seeing Node version when using nvm

## Package Management

### Approach 1: Using requirements.txt

Similar to using `package.json` with fixed versions:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Generate requirements.txt

Like `npm init` or generating `package.json`:

```bash
pip3 install pipreqs
pipreqs . --force --ignore .venv
```

💡 **Tips**:

- Check installed packages: `pip3 list` (similar to `npm list`)
- Search for packages: `pip3 search package_name` (like `npm search`)
- View package info: `pip3 show package_name` (similar to `npm view`)
- Check outdated packages: `pip3 list --outdated` (like `npm outdated`)

### Approach 2: Using Poetry

Poetry is more like modern JavaScript package managers (yarn/pnpm):

```bash
# Installation
# Unix/macOS
sudo apt install python3-poetry
# or
pip3 install poetry

# Windows
pip install poetry
```

#### Common Poetry Commands

```bash
# Like yarn install
poetry install

# Like yarn add
poetry add package-name

# Like yarn remove
poetry remove package-name

# Like yarn upgrade
poetry update
```

💡 **Tip**: `poetry.lock` is similar to `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json`

## Running the Application

### Streamlit Setup

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

💡 **Tip**: This is similar to `npm start` or `yarn dev` - it starts a development server

### Custom Port Configuration

Create `.streamlit/config.toml` (similar to `.env` files):

```toml
[server]
port = 8085
```

## Quick Tips for JavaScript Developers

1. **Package Management**:
   - `pip` → `npm`
   - `requirements.txt` → `package.json`
   - `poetry` → `yarn/pnpm`

2. **Environment**:
   - `.venv` → `node_modules`
   - `activate` script → `nvm use`
   - `pip list` → `npm list`

3. **Common Gotchas**:
   - Always check if virtual environment is activated (look for `.venv` prefix)
   - Use `python3` instead of `python` on Unix systems
   - Remember to deactivate venv when switching projects
   - Keep `requirements.txt` or `poetry.lock` in version control (like package.json)

4. **Development Workflow**:
   - Use `ruff` for linting (similar to ESLint)
   - Consider using VS Code with Python extension (similar to JavaScript extensions)
   - Set up `.gitignore` to exclude `.venv` (like excluding `node_modules`)

Remember: Python's package management is more like npm's older versions - global vs local installations matter, and virtual environments are crucial for project isolation.

For the cleanest experience, treat each Python project like a separate JavaScript project with its own dependencies and environment settings, which e will cover in next blog
