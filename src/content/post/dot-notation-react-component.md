## Using Dot Notation for Functional Components in React

For a cleaner way to manage your functional components, consider using dot notation. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. Create an object that maps your components in a single file:

    ```tsx title='Problem.tsx'
    import { Letter } from './Letter';
    import { Timer } from './Timer';

    export const Problem = {
    Letter: Letter,
    Timer: Timer
    }
    ```

2. Then use this object in your main application file like this:

```tsx title='App.tsx'
import { Problem } from './components/Problem';

const App = () => (
  <main className='main'>
    <Problem.Timer />
    <Problem.Letter />
  </main>
);
```

This approach simplifies your imports and keeps your code organized.
